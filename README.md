# cowCode

WhatsApp bot that replies using your **local or cloud LLM** (LM Studio, Ollama, OpenAI, etc.).
You chat in **"Message yourself"**, and the bot replies there.

---

# 🚀 Install (Do This First)

### 1️⃣ Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bishwashere/cowCode/master/install.sh | bash
```

### 2️⃣ Start the bot (every time you want to use it)

```bash
npm start
# or
pnpm start
# or
yarn start
```

That's it.

---

# 🔄 Update (get the latest code)

From inside your cowCode folder (keeps your config, WhatsApp link, and reminders):

```bash
cd cowCode && curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bishwashere/cowCode/master/update.sh | bash
```

Then start as usual: `npm start`

---

# 💬 How to Use

• Open WhatsApp
• Go to **Message yourself** (or "Note to self")
• Send a message
• The bot replies in the same chat

You can say things like:

* "remind me in 5 minutes"
* "search for AI trends"
* "summarize today's tasks"

Cron reminders and web search are already enabled.

---

# 🔗 If WhatsApp Linking Fails

Run:

```bash
npm run auth -- --pair 1234567890
```

Replace with your full phone number (no +).

Then in WhatsApp:
Settings → Linked Devices → **Link with phone number** → enter the 8-digit code.

---

# ⚙️ Basic Requirements

• Node.js 18 or newer
• Your local LLM (like LM Studio or Ollama) must be running before starting the bot
• npm, pnpm, or yarn

---

# 🧠 LLM Configuration (Optional)

File: `config.json`

Local models are tried first by default.

Example:

```json
{
  "llm": {
    "maxTokens": 2048,
    "models": [
      { "provider": "lmstudio", "baseUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1", "model": "local" },
      { "provider": "openai", "apiKey": "LLM_1_API_KEY", "model": "gpt-4o", "priority": true }
    ]
  }
}
```

Rules:
• Set `"priority": true` on one model if you want it always tried first
• Local providers (lmstudio, ollama) use `baseUrl`
• Cloud providers use API keys in `.env`

Built-in providers:
openai, grok/xai, together, deepseek, ollama, lmstudio

---

# 🛠 Skills (On by Default)

Configured in `config.json`.

```json
"skills": {
  "enabled": ["cron", "browser"]
}
```

Remove a skill name to disable it.

---

# ⏰ Reminders (Cron)

Say:

* "remind me to call John in 10 minutes"
* "list my reminders"

CLI commands:

```bash
pnpm run cron list
pnpm run cron remove <job-id>
```

Jobs are stored in:

```
cron/jobs.json
```

---

# 🌐 Web Search (Browser Skill)

Default search provider: Brave.

If you have a Brave API key:

```
BRAVE_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

If not:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

The bot will automatically search the web when needed.

---

# 🧪 Tests (Optional)

```bash
pnpm run test:browser
pnpm run test:browser-e2e
pnpm run test:all
```

---

# 📌 Where Messages Work

• Message yourself → replies there
• Other chats → replies when someone messages your linked number

---

That's all you need to start using cowCode.
