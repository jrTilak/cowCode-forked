# Go read

Read-only filesystem commands. Enable **go-read** in configuration (`skills.enabled`) to list dirs and read files.

Call `run_skill` with **skill: "go-read"**. Set **command** or **arguments.action** to the command name. Set **arguments.argv** to an array of arguments (e.g. paths, flags).

## Commands (allowlist)

- **ls** — List directory contents. argv: e.g. `["-la"]`, `["-la", "~/Downloads"]`
- **cd** — Change directory and output the new path. argv: `["/path"]`. Returns the resolved path.
- **pwd** — Print working directory. argv: `[]`
- **cat** — Output file contents. argv: `["/path/to/file"]`
- **less** — View file (non-interactive). argv: `["/path/to/file"]` or with flags

## Arguments

- **arguments.command** or **arguments.action** (required) — One of: ls, cd, pwd, cat, less
- **arguments.argv** (required) — Array of strings (flags and paths). Do not include the command name.
- **arguments.cwd** (optional) — Working directory. Defaults to workspace.

## When to use

Use when the user asks to list a directory, show file contents (cat/less), or resolve a path. Prefer **read** skill for reading with line ranges; use **go-read** for "list files", "what's in Downloads", "cat this file", etc.

## Example

List Downloads:
`run_skill` with skill: "go-read", arguments: { command: "ls", argv: ["-la", "~/Downloads"] }
