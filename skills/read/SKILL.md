# Read

Grabs a file's contents and returns every line. Like **peeking without touching** — no edits, no side effects.

Call **run_skill** with **skill: "read"**. Set **command** or **arguments.action** to **read**.

## Arguments

- **arguments.path** (required) — File path to read. Can be relative to workspace (e.g. `surface/main.py`, `MEMORY.md`), absolute (e.g. `/path/to/file`), or use `~` for home (e.g. `~/.cowcode/config.json`).
- **arguments.from** (optional) — Start at 1-based line number.
- **arguments.lines** (optional) — Max number of lines to return (default: all).

## When to use

Use when the user says things like:
- "Read surface main.py"
- "Show me the contents of config.json"
- "What's in MEMORY.md?"
- "Peek at index.js"
- **"Where is cowcode installed?"** or **"Where is my config?"** — use read with **arguments.path** `~/.cowcode/config.json` to show the config file and confirm paths (state dir: ~/.cowcode, workspace: ~/.cowcode/workspace, install: ~/.local/share/cowcode unless COWCODE_INSTALL_DIR is set).
- "What's in my config?" / "Show me my config" — use read with path `~/.cowcode/config.json`.

The skill returns the file content as text. No modifications are made.
